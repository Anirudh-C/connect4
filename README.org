* Connect4
  This is a primitive connect4 game in Emacs.
** Getting Started
   First clone the repository
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/anirudh-c/connect4 /path/to/directory
   #+END_SRC
   To load the package into emacs, press <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd> and give the path to the file connect4.el as /path/to/directory/connect4.el
   
   Now to start the game press <kbd>M-x connect4</kbd>
   
   Navigate to any of the '.' points in the matrix and press <kbd>M-x connect4-mark</kbd>.

   **Note:** The game always starts with an X. And since this is an initial primitive build you have unlimited power to mark your Xs and Os everywhere.
   Later versions will take care of the marking and provide an AI to play against. Till then, play fair.
** Installation
   To "install" connect4, put the file in the directory ~/.emacs.d/lisp/ and put the following in your init.el:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
   (load "connect4")
   #+END_SRC
** Documentation
   No docs for now..will get there
